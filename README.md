# UmbracoToggleBookmarklet
This is an easy to use Umbraco toggle Bookmarklet, inspired by https://gist.github.com/apphutdev/d06630ac639e65c8b10757df6b13d0ae
This has only been tested in Chrome

You can regenerate the file by editing the src file and running the grunt default task. If you are only interested in the bookmarklet, just copy the contents of /dist/bookmarklet-dist.js to a new bookmark
